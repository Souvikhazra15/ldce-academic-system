AUTHENTICATION FLOW:
====================

FIRST TIME LOGIN:
1. User navigates to app → sees LoginPage
2. User clicks "Sign in with Google"
3. Google authentication dialog opens
4. User authenticates with their Google account
5. LoginPage validates email domain (must be @college.ac.in or configured domain)
6. If valid: Faculty data stored in localStorage
7. App.jsx detects authentication state and renders Dashboard
8. User sees navbar with their name
9. User can click "Logout" to clear session

SUBSEQUENT VISITS:
1. User navigates to app
2. App.jsx checks localStorage for existing "facultyAuth" data
3. If found: User is automatically logged in to Dashboard
4. If not found: User sees LoginPage

LOGOUT PROCESS:
1. User clicks "Logout" in navbar user menu
2. onLogout callback is triggered
3. All auth data cleared from localStorage
4. isAuthenticated set to false
5. App.jsx renders LoginPage again

KEY FEATURES:
=============

✓ Google Domain-Based Authentication
  - Faculty must use college domain email
  - Configurable allowed domains in ALLOWED_DOMAINS array
  - Real-time validation feedback

✓ Persistent Sessions
  - Faculty stays logged in after browser refresh
  - Sessions persist until manual logout
  - Token stored securely in localStorage

✓ User Experience
  - Clean, professional UI with gradient background
  - One-click login (no password entry needed)

✓ Security Features
  - JWT token validation on client side
  - Domain email verification
  - Logout functionality to clear session
  - Token stored in browser (can be enhanced to secure cookies in production)

CONFIGURATION REQUIRED:
======================

1. Get Google Client ID:
   - Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/
   - Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID (Web Application)
   - Add redirect URIs: http://localhost:5173, https://yourdomain.com
   - Copy the CLIENT ID

2. Update LoginPage.jsx:
   - Replace "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID_HERE" with actual Client ID
   - Update ALLOWED_DOMAINS array with your college email domains

3. (Optional) Configure Backend Verification:
   - Send token to backend API for verification
   - Create session on backend
   - Follow security best practices

TESTING THE LOGIN:
==================

1. npm start
2. App loads with LoginPage visible
3. Click "Sign in with Google"
4. Login with a test account (should match configured domain)
5. After login, you should see:
   - Dashboard page
   - Navbar with faculty name
   - All 5 tabs functional (Dashboard, Attendance, Assessment, CO-PO View, Report)
   - Logout option in user menu

TO TEST LOGOUT:
1. Click user profile dropdown in navbar (top right)
2. Click "Logout"
3. LoginPage should appear again
4. Session data cleared from localStorage

DATA STRUCTURE:
===============

Faculty Auth Data (stored in localStorage as "facultyAuth"):
{
  id: "google_user_id",
  name: "Faculty Name",
  email: "faculty@college.ac.in",
  picture: "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/...",
  loginTime: "2024-12-19T10:30:00.000Z",
  token: "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IjE2..."
}

Token (stored separately as "authToken" for API calls)

NEXT STEPS:
===========

1. Replace "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID_HERE" with actual Google Client ID
2. Configure ALLOWED_DOMAINS to match your college email domains
3. Test login flow with valid college domain email
4. (Production) Set up backend API verification for tokens
5. (Production) Switch to secure cookie storage instead of localStorage
6. (Production) Add token refresh logic and expiration handling
